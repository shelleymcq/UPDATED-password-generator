## Description
A simple app to produce a random password according to a user's specifications for length and type of character to include. Updated version of class project built from scratch without starter code.

## Story
I am going to redo particularly interesting or challenging class projects from scratch to see how far I've come in my learning to code journey.

### Original Project
The password generator was our first JavaScript project. While I managed to build a functioning app, I did not really understand why it worked.

## Four Years Later
I needed a bunch of test email accounts and random passwords, so decided to use my old baby password generator from bootcamp ðŸ’–

And now I know all the things that are wrong with this one!

### Next Steps - someday...
* Get rid of those alerts and use inputs and checkboxes for each
* No numbers or special characters at the beginning of password
* A UI that isn't so...awful? No offense to baby me, but ooh boy have I gotten better 
* And why is it generating one more character than requested????? ðŸ˜‚
