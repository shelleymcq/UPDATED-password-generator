## Description
A simple app to produce a random password according to a user's specifications for length and type of character to include. Updated version of class project built from scratch without starter code.

## Story
I am going to redo particularly interesting or challenging class projects from scratch to see how far I've come in my learning to code journey.

### Original Project
The password generator was our first JavaScript project. While I managed to build a functioning app, I did not really understand why it worked.
